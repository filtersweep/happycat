A silly thing my kids and I came up with.  It's now my default place to test client-side technologies.

To make it work, copy the contents of src/ to any web accessible place, then view in your browser of choice.

Documentation is in doc/ and was generated by JSDoc.

Tests are in test/ and were written for js-test-driver.

build.xml has shortcuts for generating docs, running test, and checking code with jslint (assuming you have the right tools in the right places).
